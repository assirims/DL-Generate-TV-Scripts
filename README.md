## Generate TV Scripts as a part of the Deep Learning Nanodegree

In this project, I generate my own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. 
I use part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. 
The Neural Network I built generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.
